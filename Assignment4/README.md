## Submitting your assignment

* Create a folder for your python files​
* Use your username+StudentID (mkdir dgarijo-1234456)​
* Copy task06 and task07 to that folder​
* Make the corresponding changes to complete the tasks​
* Transform your notebook into a Python script:​
```
    File -> download -> py​
```

* Optionally you can submit tasks 8-9​

* Do a pull request **ONLY** with your files (use git status)​
* **Do not** upload python notebooks, as they are hard to inspect in a pull request. ** Pull requests with notebooks will not be accepted​ **
* **Do not** include different assignments into the same pull request​
* Do different pull requests for each assignment​
